    "There are in total 8 different functions, or e-utilities, which access the database in different ways. Most of the utilities will return XML data, although some of them have the option to return a more convenient JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the search API is available at the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi\n",
    "If we want to search for the term fever, the URL we need is for example:\n",

    "retmode=json, to have a JSON string in response and not an XML\n",

    "sort=relevance, the results are sorted by relevance and not by added date which is the default ranking option on pubmed\n",

    "This search session will provide a number of PubMed IDs (probably 20) corresponding to the top citations which match our query.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get some more details about these citations, we can use the efetch utility, which takes one or more citation ID as input. At the moment, the efetch utility does not return JSON, so XML is the only option to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of citation IDs, the fetch operation can be built as follows\n",

    "http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&retmode=xml&id=ID1,ID2,...\n",
    "At this point, the response will be an XML to handle with e.g. minidom or other XML library. Please notice that we can query the efetch utility for multiple documents, simply by separating them with a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it’s relatively easy to create the appropriate request using libraries like urllib.request or, better, requests. The response can be parsed with the json module, or minidom in case of XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "An even more convenient way to do the job is to use an existing library that does what we need for us. A good example is Biopython, a comprehensive package for biological computation in Python.\""

       "{'abstract': ['Prompt and widely available diagnostics of breast cancer is crucial for the prognosis of patients. One of the diagnostic methods is the analysis of cytological material from the breast. This examination requires extensive knowledge and experience of the cytologist. Computer-aided diagnosis can speed up the diagnostic process and allow for large-scale screening. One of the largest challenges in the automatic analysis of cytological images is the segmentation of nuclei. In this study, four different clustering algorithms are tested and compared in the task of fast nuclei segmentation. K-means, fuzzy C-means, competitive learning neural networks and Gaussian mixture models were incorporated for clustering in the color space along with adaptive thresholding in grayscale. These methods were applied in a medical decision support system for breast cancer diagnosis, where the cases were classified as either benign or malignant. In the segmented nuclei, 42 morphological, topological and texture features were extracted. Then, these features were used in a classification procedure with three different classifiers. The system was tested for classification accuracy by means of microscopic images of fine needle breast biopsies. In cooperation with the Regional Hospital in Zielona Góra, 500 real case medical images from 50 patients were collected. The acquired classification accuracy was approximately 96-100%, which is very promising and shows that the presented method ensures accurate and objective data acquisition that could be used to facilitate breast cancer diagnosis.'],\n",

      "|Histopathology is the clinical standard for tissue diagnosis; however, it requires tissue processing, laboratory personnel and infrastructure, and a highly trained pathologist to diagnose the tissue. Optical microscopy can provide real-time diagnosis, which could be used to inform the management of breast cancer. The goal of this work is to obtain images of tissue morphology through fluorescence microscopy and vital fluorescent stains and to develop a strategy to segment and quantify breast tissue features in order to enable automated tissue diagnosis.

      "|Prompt and widely available diagnostics of breast cancer is crucial for the prognosis of patients. One of the diagnostic methods is the analysis of cytological material from the breast. This examination requires extensive knowledge and experience of the cytologist. Computer-aided diagnosis can speed up the diagnostic process and allow for large-scale screening. One of the largest challenges in the automatic analysis of cytological images is the segmentation of nuclei. In this study, four different clustering algorithms are tested and compared in the task of fast nuclei segmentation. K-means, fuzzy C-means, competitive learning neural networks and Gaussian mixture models were incorporated for clustering in the color space along with adaptive thresholding in grayscale. These methods were applied in a medical decision support system for breast cancer diagnosis, where the cases were classified as either benign or malignant. In the segmented nuclei, 42 morphological, topological and texture features were extracted. Then, these features were used in a classification procedure with three different classifiers. The system was tested for classification accuracy by means of microscopic images of fine needle breast biopsies. In cooperation with the Regional Hospital in Zielona Góra, 500 real case medical images from 50 patients were collected. The acquired classification accuracy was approximately 96-100%, which is very promising and shows that the presented method ensures accurate and objective data acquisition that could be used to facilitate breast cancer diagnosis.

      "|Cell nuclei classification in breast cancer histopathology images plays an important role in effective diagnose since breast cancer can often be characterized by its expression in cell nuclei. However, due to the small and variant sizes of cell nuclei, and heavy noise in histopathology images, traditional machine learning methods cannot achieve desirable recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper aims to present a novel deep neural network which performs representation learning and cell nuclei recognition in an end-to-end manner.

      "|Digital cytology plays an increasingly important role in breast cancer diagnosis. However, analysis of cytologic images is a very difficult task. Especially, nuclei segmentation is extremely challenging. In our work on fully automated medical diagnosis system we encountered the problem of densely clustered nuclei. We decided to use a segmentation algorithm that is rather rarely found in the literature. Multi-label fast marching was applied and compared to well-known and extensively used seeded watershed algorithm. In both methods, it is critical to determine the appropriate starting points (seeds). The seeds were determined using a combination of adaptive thresholding in grayscale, clustering in color space and conditional erosion. The proposed segmentation procedure was tested for suitability for diagnosis of the cancer. Experiments were conducted on a set of 450 microscopic images of fine needle biopsies obtained from patients of the Regional Hospital in Zielona Góra, Poland. The images were classified as either benign or malignant using 84 features extracted from isolated nuclei. Both methods gave very promising results and showed that our method is effective and can be successfully applied for computer-aided diagnosis system.

      "|Fine needle aspiration, an accepted minimally invasive diagnostic procedure for breast masses, leads to an indeterminate (borderline) diagnosis in a significant proportion of cases. This study was aimed at evaluation of the utility of image analysis and morphometry in the cytologic assessment of borderline breast cases. A 'study' group of 45 cases (including fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change and ductal carcinoma) and a 'test' group of 25 cytologically borderline cases were included. Nuclei from each of the groups (nuclei of monolayer sheet of fibroadenoma, naked nuclei of fibroadenoma, ductal cells nuclei of fibrocystic change and nuclei of carcinoma) were manually traced and analyzed using self-written image analysis software. Discriminant analysis was done on the 'study' group and the resultant discriminant functions were applied to the 'test' group. The percentage of nuclei correctly classified of the study as well as test group was noted. On step-wise discriminant analysis, various morphometric, textural parameters and color information parameters were selected. Of the original 'study' group, 98.49% of nuclei could be correctly classified. No overlapping of benign and malignant nuclei was observed in the 'study' group. When the resulting functions were tested on the 'test' group, all the cases were correctly classified as benign or malignant (compared with the final histologic diagnosis). This study suggests that application of computerized image analysis to cytologically borderline breast cases can help in the classification of these cases as benign or malignant. This may prevent unnecessary surgery in many of these cases.

      "|The cytological technique takes a leading position in diagnostic of tumor processes according exudative fluids. However, its results depend on large number of subjective factors. The morphometry is one of techniques by virtue of which objectification of data of cytological analysis is possible. The study was carried out to establish differences of morphometric parameters of benign and malignant cells of pleural effusion. The morphometric analysis of cells of mesothelium, breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of lung and adenocarcinoma of stomach was implemented. The parameters characterizing size (area, perimeter) and form (form factor) of nucleus and cell, nucleus-cytoplasm ratio. The results demonstrated that in pleural effusion between cells of proliferating mesothelium and malignant neoplasms exist significant differences in morphometric parameters (p<0.001). The differences between area of nuclei and cells are especially significant. The comparison of data of morphometry of cells of breast cancer; adenocarcinoma of lung and adenocarcinoma of stomach demonstrated that despite of some morphological similarities, analysis of morphometric parameters can provide important data for proper establishment of cytological diagnosis.

      "|For cancer detection from microscopic biopsy images, image segmentation step used for segmentation of cells and nuclei play an important role. Accuracy of segmentation approach dominate the final results. Also the microscopic biopsy images have intrinsic Poisson noise and if it is present in the image the segmentation results may not be accurate. The objective is to propose an efficient fuzzy c-means based segmentation approach which can also handle the noise present in the image during the segmentation process itself i.e. noise removal and segmentation is combined in one step.

      "|We investigated the in vivo expression of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 (key molecules for G2-M transition during the cell cycle) in nonmalignant and cancerous human breast lesions using immunohistochemistry and quantitative proliferative index (PI) analysis. Breast epithelial cells co-expressed cyclin B1 and Cdc2 in their cytoplasm in the G2 phase and in their nuclei in the M phase. Cyclin B1, but not Cdc2, immunostaining rapidly disappeared from the nuclei during the mitotic metaphase to anaphase transition. Static image analysis revealed the mean proliferative index for cyclin B1/cdc2 for each type of lesion to be as follows: normal glands (n = 20), 2.0/2.5%; benign lesions, including typical ductal hyperplasia (n = 76), 2.5/5.8%; atypical ductal hyperplasia (n = 21), 3.0/6.6%; carcinomas in situ (n = 70), 7.4/14.0%; and invasive carcinomas (n = 58), 10.0/22.9%. Proliferative index data for atypical hyperplasia were virtually identical to those for benign lesions and were significantly lower than those for breast cancer, suggesting that expression levels of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 may be used to distinguish premalignant human breast lesions from advanced disease. Furthermore, the proliferative index for cyclin B1 for comedo-type ductal carcinomas in situ agreed with that for invasive ductal carcinomas (mean, 10.1% versus 9.5%), apparently explaining the clinicopathological aggressiveness of this tumor at the molecular level.

      "|Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has become an exciting new instrument because of its increased resolution over conventional wide-field microscopy and its high performance three-dimensional (3D) optical sectioning. Although CLSM has been used extensively in cell biology, few applications have been reported in routine clinical pathology. In this study, 3D reconstruction was performed on routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of normal mammary duct, simple ductal hyperplasia, intraductal papillary hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive carcinoma, and lymph node metastatic carcinomas of the human breast by using computer-assisted CLSM in conjunction with a 3D reconstruction software package (microVoxel). The selected specimens were sectioned at 30 microns, mounted on glass slides, and stained with the DNA fluorescent probe, YOYO-1 iodide. The nuclear DNA and chromatin texture were clearly demonstrated after pretreatment with RNAase and hydrolysis with 2 N HCl. High quality 3D images were obtained by processing the optical section stacks with volume render and surface display parameters in microVoxel. 3D morphologic characteristics of different breast lesions were examined in various orientations by angular image rotation. The clearly benign lesions (simple ductal hyperplasia and intraductal papillary hyperplasia) revealed similar 3D morphologic features, including: (1) smooth nuclear surface and homogeneous chromatin fluorescence intensity; (2) hyperplastic cell nuclei showing similar shape and volume; and (3) clearcut margin of basement membrane defined by spindle-shaped myocytes of the ductal outer layer. In contrast, carcinomas displayed remarkably different features in 3D morphology, including: (1) irregular nuclear surface: (2) marked nuclear pleomorphism (irregular, angulated and indented shape of nuclear volume); (3) irregular and coarse chromatin texture; (4) chaotic arrangement of tumor cell nuclei; and (5) absence of myocytes, indicating no clear margin at the site of infiltration of cancer cells. In conclusion, nuclear structure, specifically demonstrated by CLSM of YOYO-1 iodide fluorescently stained cells, used in tandem with 3D volume morphologic reconstruction, may provide a useful research diagnostic tool in pathology.|Three-dimensional reconstruction by confocal laser scanning microscopy in routine pathologic specimens of benign and malignant lesions of the human breast.

      "|We studied whether a computer-assisted system using a combination of data collection by image analysis and analysis by neural networks can differentiate benign and malignant breast lesions. Forty-six intraductal lesions of the breast were studied by pathologists and by the computer-assisted system. Histological evaluation was performed independently by three pathologists, and the lesions were classified into pathologically malignant (n = 12), undetermined (n = 13), and benign (n = 21). Computerized nuclear image analysis was performed using the CAS200 (Cell Analysis Systems, Elmhurst, IL) system to obtain data on nuclear morphometric and textural features. A neural network was constructed using the morphometric and texture data obtained from teaching cases of malignant and benign lesions. Then data for unknown cases were classified by the constructed neural network into neural network-malignant (n = 11), -undetermined (n = 5), and -benign (n = 30). The agreement rate between the diagnosis by pathologists and judgment by the computer-assisted system was 75%, excluding pathologically undetermined lesions. There were four false-negative but no false-positive results. False-negative cases had nuclei that were quite different from those of the teaching cases. The agreement rate obtained using either morphometric data or texture data only was lower than that using a combination of both. Selection of appropriate teaching data and incorporation of both morphometric and textural parameters seemed important for obtaining more accurate results. The present data suggest that development of a computer-assisted histopathological diagnosis system for practical use may be possible.

      "|In order to develop an objective grading system for nuclear atypia in breast cancer, an image analysis technique has been applied for the automated recognition of enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei in cytology specimens. The image segmentation algorithm, based on the 'top hat' image transformation developed in mathematical morphology, is implemented on the LEYTAS automated microscope system. The performance of the segmentation algorithm has been evaluated for fifty malignant and eighty-five benign breast lesions by visual inspection of the displayed 'flagged' objects. The mean number of flagged objects per 1600 image fields for breast cancers was 887 (range 0-7920) of which 87% consisted of single, atypical nuclei. For benign lesions the mean number was 30 (range 0-307) of which 20% were single nuclei. By adaptation of the 'top hat' parameter values, a more extreme subpopulation of atypical nuclei could be discriminated. The large interspecimen variation in the breast cancer results was related to differences in DNA content distribution and mean nuclear area, determined independently with scanning cytophotometry, and

      "|We have been testing two independent hypotheses which postulate that the malignant potential of early breast cancer can be objectively assessed by measuring nuclear features of the diagnostic-malignant cells (hypothesis I) and/or normal-appearing epithelial cells found in the vicinity of the carcinoma (hypothesis II). In preliminary experiments, we tested some of these hypotheses using historical samples and a high resolution image cytometry apparatus. Tissue sections were stained with our stoichiometric stain and over 60 nuclear features, primarily texture features describing the DNA distribution in the nuclei, were employed in the multivariate analyses. Data derived from measurements of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with and without the invasive component indicated that the malignant potential of these lesions can be estimated with a sensitivity and specificity of at least 80%. The analysis of the tissue surrounding an invasive breast carcinoma showed that the existing malignancy can be predicted solely from the measurements of normal nuclei (normal-appearing breast lobules) in more than 85% of patients. This result indicates that the analysis of benign tissues also could give prognostically valid information. These results can be greatly improved using larger sample sizes and other improvements, including technical improvements of the cytometry device. We believe that this approach can be developed into a practical diagnostic and prognostic tool for better management of early breast cancer.

Sixty-one cases including fibroadenoma (FA), fibrocystic disease (FCD), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma (IC) were studied by image analysis to evaluate quantitative changes in AgNORs in both Ki67-positive, and Ki67-negative smears. The Ki67 index was assessed. Morphometric features of cell nuclei and AgNORs were determined by digitized computer image analysis (Prodit 5.2). The growth fraction was 5.08 for FA, 5.71 for FCD, 16.75 for DCIS and 23.26 for IC. The mean nuclear area was significantly higher in malignant cells than those of fibroadenoma and fibrocystic disease. In Ki67-positive cells the total area, long axis and number of AgNORs increased progressively across disease groups. Eccentricity of AgNORs and AgNORs: nuclear area ratios were significantly increased in malignant breast lesion in comparison with benign lesion in Ki67 positive cells. In Ki67 negative cells, the highest value of AgNORs was observed in DCIS. The AgNORs: nuclear area ratio demonstrated a statistically significant trend across the disease groups. This study demonstrates that the growth fraction, mean nuclear area and selected AgNORs features have potential for differentiating benign from malignant breast tumours.
