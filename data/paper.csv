"Histopathology is the clinical standard for tissue diagnosis; however, it requires tissue processing, laboratory personnel and infrastructure, and a highly trained pathologist to diagnose the tissue. Optical microscopy can provide real-time diagnosis, which could be used to inform the management of breast cancer. The goal of this work is to obtain images of tissue morphology through fluorescence microscopy and vital fluorescent stains and to develop a strategy to segment and quantify breast tissue features in order to enable automated tissue diagnosis.",Rapid staining and imaging of subnuclear features to differentiate between malignant and benign breast tissues at a point-of-care setting.
"Accurate detection of breast malignancy from histologically normal cells (""field effect"") has significant clinical implications in a broad base of breast cancer management, such as high-risk lesion management, personalized risk assessment, breast tumor recurrence, and tumor margin management. More accurate and clinically applicable tools to detect markers characteristic of breast cancer ""field effect"" that are able to guide the clinical management are urgently needed. We have recently developed a novel optical microscope, spatial-domain low-coherence quantitative phase microscopy, which extracts the nanoscale structural characteristics of cell nuclei (i.e., nuclear nano-morphology markers), using standard histology slides. In this proof-of-concept study, we present the use of these highly sensitive nuclear nano-morphology markers to identify breast malignancy from histologically normal cells. We investigated the nano-morphology markers from 154 patients with a broad spectrum of breast pathology entities, including normal breast tissue, non-proliferative benign lesions, proliferative lesions (without and with atypia), ""malignant-adjacent"" normal tissue, and invasive carcinoma. Our results show that the nuclear nano-morphology markers of ""malignant-adjacent"" normal tissue can detect the presence of invasive breast carcinoma with high accuracy and do not reflect normal aging. Further, we found that a progressive change in nuclear nano-morphology markers that parallel breast cancer risk, suggesting its potential use for risk stratification. These novel nano-morphology markers that detect breast cancerous changes from nanoscale structural characteristics of histologically normal cells could potentially benefit the diagnosis, risk assessment, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of breast cancer.","Nuclear nano-morphology markers of histologically normal cells detect the ""field effect"" of breast cancer."
"Prompt and widely available diagnostics of breast cancer is crucial for the prognosis of patients. One of the diagnostic methods is the analysis of cytological material from the breast. This examination requires extensive knowledge and experience of the cytologist. Computer-aided diagnosis can speed up the diagnostic process and allow for large-scale screening. One of the largest challenges in the automatic analysis of cytological images is the segmentation of nuclei. In this study, four different clustering algorithms are tested and compared in the task of fast nuclei segmentation. K-means, fuzzy C-means, competitive learning neural networks and Gaussian mixture models were incorporated for clustering in the color space along with adaptive thresholding in grayscale. These methods were applied in a medical decision support system for breast cancer diagnosis, where the cases were classified as either benign or malignant. In the segmented nuclei, 42 morphological, topological and texture features were extracted. Then, these features were used in a classification procedure with three different classifiers. The system was tested for classification accuracy by means of microscopic images of fine needle breast biopsies. In cooperation with the Regional Hospital in Zielona Góra, 500 real case medical images from 50 patients were collected. The acquired classification accuracy was approximately 96-100%, which is very promising and shows that the presented method ensures accurate and objective data acquisition that could be used to facilitate breast cancer diagnosis.",Computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer based on fine needle biopsy microscopic images.
"Cell nuclei classification in breast cancer histopathology images plays an important role in effective diagnose since breast cancer can often be characterized by its expression in cell nuclei. However, due to the small and variant sizes of cell nuclei, and heavy noise in histopathology images, traditional machine learning methods cannot achieve desirable recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper aims to present a novel deep neural network which performs representation learning and cell nuclei recognition in an end-to-end manner.",Breast cancer cell nuclei classification in histopathology images using deep neural networks.
"Grading schemes for breast cancer diagnosis are predominantly based on pathologists' qualitative assessment of altered nuclear structure from 2D brightfield microscopy images. However, cells are three-dimensional (3D) objects with features that are inherently 3D and thus poorly characterized in 2D. Our goal is to quantitatively characterize nuclear structure in 3D, assess its variation with malignancy, and investigate whether such variation correlates with standard nuclear grading criteria.","Isotropic 3D nuclear morphometry of normal, fibrocystic and malignant breast epithelial cells reveals new structural alterations."
"Digital cytology plays an increasingly important role in breast cancer diagnosis. However, analysis of cytologic images is a very difficult task. Especially, nuclei segmentation is extremely challenging. In our work on fully automated medical diagnosis system we encountered the problem of densely clustered nuclei. We decided to use a segmentation algorithm that is rather rarely found in the literature. Multi-label fast marching was applied and compared to well-known and extensively used seeded watershed algorithm. In both methods, it is critical to determine the appropriate starting points (seeds). The seeds were determined using a combination of adaptive thresholding in grayscale, clustering in color space and conditional erosion. The proposed segmentation procedure was tested for suitability for diagnosis of the cancer. Experiments were conducted on a set of 450 microscopic images of fine needle biopsies obtained from patients of the Regional Hospital in Zielona Góra, Poland. The images were classified as either benign or malignant using 84 features extracted from isolated nuclei. Both methods gave very promising results and showed that our method is effective and can be successfully applied for computer-aided diagnosis system.",Multi-label fast marching and seeded watershed segmentation methods for diagnosis of breast cancer cytology.

"Fine needle aspiration, an accepted minimally invasive diagnostic procedure for breast masses, leads to an indeterminate (borderline) diagnosis in a significant proportion of cases. This study was aimed at evaluation of the utility of image analysis and morphometry in the cytologic assessment of borderline breast cases. A 'study' group of 45 cases (including fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change and ductal carcinoma) and a 'test' group of 25 cytologically borderline cases were included. Nuclei from each of the groups (nuclei of monolayer sheet of fibroadenoma, naked nuclei of fibroadenoma, ductal cells nuclei of fibrocystic change and nuclei of carcinoma) were manually traced and analyzed using self-written image analysis software. Discriminant analysis was done on the 'study' group and the resultant discriminant functions were applied to the 'test' group. The percentage of nuclei correctly classified of the study as well as test group was noted. On step-wise discriminant analysis, various morphometric, textural parameters and color information parameters were selected. Of the original 'study' group, 98.49% of nuclei could be correctly classified. No overlapping of benign and malignant nuclei was observed in the 'study' group. When the resulting functions were tested on the 'test' group, all the cases were correctly classified as benign or malignant (compared with the final histologic diagnosis). This study suggests that application of computerized image analysis to cytologically borderline breast cases can help in the classification of these cases as benign or malignant. This may prevent unnecessary surgery in many of these cases.",Role of morphometry in evaluation of cytologically borderline breast lesions: a study of 70 cases.
"The cytological technique takes a leading position in diagnostic of tumor processes according exudative fluids. However, its results depend on large number of subjective factors. The morphometry is one of techniques by virtue of which objectification of data of cytological analysis is possible. The study was carried out to establish differences of morphometric parameters of benign and malignant cells of pleural effusion. The morphometric analysis of cells of mesothelium, breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of lung and adenocarcinoma of stomach was implemented. The parameters characterizing size (area, perimeter) and form (form factor) of nucleus and cell, nucleus-cytoplasm ratio. The results demonstrated that in pleural effusion between cells of proliferating mesothelium and malignant neoplasms exist significant differences in morphometric parameters (p<0.001). The differences between area of nuclei and cells are especially significant. The comparison of data of morphometry of cells of breast cancer; adenocarcinoma of lung and adenocarcinoma of stomach demonstrated that despite of some morphological similarities, analysis of morphometric parameters can provide important data for proper establishment of cytological diagnosis.",[THE MORPHOMETRY IN CYTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF EXUDATIVE FLUIDS].
"For cancer detection from microscopic biopsy images, image segmentation step used for segmentation of cells and nuclei play an important role. Accuracy of segmentation approach dominate the final results. Also the microscopic biopsy images have intrinsic Poisson noise and if it is present in the image the segmentation results may not be accurate. The objective is to propose an efficient fuzzy c-means based segmentation approach which can also handle the noise present in the image during the segmentation process itself i.e. noise removal and segmentation is combined in one step.",A fourth order PDE based fuzzy c- means approach for segmentation of microscopic biopsy images in presence of Poisson noise for cancer detection.
"The morphometric parameters of the nuclear-nucleolar apparatus of benign and malignant mammary cells were investigated by computer-aided morphometry of cytological specimen stained by a 50% silver nitrate solution. On the basis of a static analysis of measurement results a computer soft was created to classify the nuclei. The soft, with respect to an analysis of the discriminative functions and to a variety of formally logical limitations, subdivides the nuclei into 6 morphotypes with variations ""a"" and ""b"", which correspond to certain clinical and morphological variants of breast diseases. From the practical viewpoint, the subdivision of nuclei into the 3rd and 4th morphotypes is most interesting because it can provide the clinical cytology expert with extra information for the differential diagnostics of proliferative and malignant transformations in the mammary glands as well as for the definition of dysplasia stages and for the determination of tumor-cell malignancy degree.",[Morphological types of the glandular epithelium nuclei from benign and malignant mammary gland diseases].

"We investigated the in vivo expression of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 (key molecules for G2-M transition during the cell cycle) in nonmalignant and cancerous human breast lesions using immunohistochemistry and quantitative proliferative index (PI) analysis. Breast epithelial cells co-expressed cyclin B1 and Cdc2 in their cytoplasm in the G2 phase and in their nuclei in the M phase. Cyclin B1, but not Cdc2, immunostaining rapidly disappeared from the nuclei during the mitotic metaphase to anaphase transition. Static image analysis revealed the mean proliferative index for cyclin B1/cdc2 for each type of lesion to be as follows: normal glands (n = 20), 2.0/2.5%; benign lesions, including typical ductal hyperplasia (n = 76), 2.5/5.8%; atypical ductal hyperplasia (n = 21), 3.0/6.6%; carcinomas in situ (n = 70), 7.4/14.0%; and invasive carcinomas (n = 58), 10.0/22.9%. Proliferative index data for atypical hyperplasia were virtually identical to those for benign lesions and were significantly lower than those for breast cancer, suggesting that expression levels of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 may be used to distinguish premalignant human breast lesions from advanced disease. Furthermore, the proliferative index for cyclin B1 for comedo-type ductal carcinomas in situ agreed with that for invasive ductal carcinomas (mean, 10.1% versus 9.5%), apparently explaining the clinicopathological aggressiveness of this tumor at the molecular level.",Expression of the G2-M checkpoint regulators cyclin B1 and cdc2 in nonmalignant and malignant human breast lesions: immunocytochemical and quantitative image analyses.
"Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has become an exciting new instrument because of its increased resolution over conventional wide-field microscopy and its high performance three-dimensional (3D) optical sectioning. Although CLSM has been used extensively in cell biology, few applications have been reported in routine clinical pathology. In this study, 3D reconstruction was performed on routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of normal mammary duct, simple ductal hyperplasia, intraductal papillary hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive carcinoma, and lymph node metastatic carcinomas of the human breast by using computer-assisted CLSM in conjunction with a 3D reconstruction software package (microVoxel). The selected specimens were sectioned at 30 microns, mounted on glass slides, and stained with the DNA fluorescent probe, YOYO-1 iodide. The nuclear DNA and chromatin texture were clearly demonstrated after pretreatment with RNAase and hydrolysis with 2 N HCl. High quality 3D images were obtained by processing the optical section stacks with volume render and surface display parameters in microVoxel. 3D morphologic characteristics of different breast lesions were examined in various orientations by angular image rotation. The clearly benign lesions (simple ductal hyperplasia and intraductal papillary hyperplasia) revealed similar 3D morphologic features, including: (1) smooth nuclear surface and homogeneous chromatin fluorescence intensity; (2) hyperplastic cell nuclei showing similar shape and volume; and (3) clearcut margin of basement membrane defined by spindle-shaped myocytes of the ductal outer layer. In contrast, carcinomas displayed remarkably different features in 3D morphology, including: (1) irregular nuclear surface: (2) marked nuclear pleomorphism (irregular, angulated and indented shape of nuclear volume); (3) irregular and coarse chromatin texture; (4) chaotic arrangement of tumor cell nuclei; and (5) absence of myocytes, indicating no clear margin at the site of infiltration of cancer cells. In conclusion, nuclear structure, specifically demonstrated by CLSM of YOYO-1 iodide fluorescently stained cells, used in tandem with 3D volume morphologic reconstruction, may provide a useful research diagnostic tool in pathology.",Three-dimensional reconstruction by confocal laser scanning microscopy in routine pathologic specimens of benign and malignant lesions of the human breast.
"We studied whether a computer-assisted system using a combination of data collection by image analysis and analysis by neural networks can differentiate benign and malignant breast lesions. Forty-six intraductal lesions of the breast were studied by pathologists and by the computer-assisted system. Histological evaluation was performed independently by three pathologists, and the lesions were classified into pathologically malignant (n = 12), undetermined (n = 13), and benign (n = 21). Computerized nuclear image analysis was performed using the CAS200 (Cell Analysis Systems, Elmhurst, IL) system to obtain data on nuclear morphometric and textural features. A neural network was constructed using the morphometric and texture data obtained from teaching cases of malignant and benign lesions. Then data for unknown cases were classified by the constructed neural network into neural network-malignant (n = 11), -undetermined (n = 5), and -benign (n = 30). The agreement rate between the diagnosis by pathologists and judgment by the computer-assisted system was 75%, excluding pathologically undetermined lesions. There were four false-negative but no false-positive results. False-negative cases had nuclei that were quite different from those of the teaching cases. The agreement rate obtained using either morphometric data or texture data only was lower than that using a combination of both. Selection of appropriate teaching data and incorporation of both morphometric and textural parameters seemed important for obtaining more accurate results. The present data suggest that development of a computer-assisted histopathological diagnosis system for practical use may be possible.",Application of image analysis and neural networks to the pathology diagnosis of intraductal proliferative lesions of the breast.

"In order to develop an objective grading system for nuclear atypia in breast cancer, an image analysis technique has been applied for the automated recognition of enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei in cytology specimens. The image segmentation algorithm, based on the 'top hat' image transformation developed in mathematical morphology, is implemented on the LEYTAS automated microscope system. The performance of the segmentation algorithm has been evaluated for fifty malignant and eighty-five benign breast lesions by visual inspection of the displayed 'flagged' objects. The mean number of flagged objects per 1600 image fields for breast cancers was 887 (range 0-7920) of which 87% consisted of single, atypical nuclei. For benign lesions the mean number was 30 (range 0-307) of which 20% were single nuclei. By adaptation of the 'top hat' parameter values, a more extreme subpopulation of atypical nuclei could be discriminated. The large interspecimen variation in the breast cancer results was related to differences in DNA content distribution and mean nuclear area, determined independently with scanning cytophotometry, and to some extent with the histological type.",Automated recognition of atypical nuclei in breast cancer cytology specimens by iterative image transformations.
"We have been testing two independent hypotheses which postulate that the malignant potential of early breast cancer can be objectively assessed by measuring nuclear features of the diagnostic-malignant cells (hypothesis I) and/or normal-appearing epithelial cells found in the vicinity of the carcinoma (hypothesis II). In preliminary experiments, we tested some of these hypotheses using historical samples and a high resolution image cytometry apparatus. Tissue sections were stained with our stoichiometric stain and over 60 nuclear features, primarily texture features describing the DNA distribution in the nuclei, were employed in the multivariate analyses. Data derived from measurements of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with and without the invasive component indicated that the malignant potential of these lesions can be estimated with a sensitivity and specificity of at least 80%. The analysis of the tissue surrounding an invasive breast carcinoma showed that the existing malignancy can be predicted solely from the measurements of normal nuclei (normal-appearing breast lobules) in more than 85% of patients. This result indicates that the analysis of benign tissues also could give prognostically valid information. These results can be greatly improved using larger sample sizes and other improvements, including technical improvements of the cytometry device. We believe that this approach can be developed into a practical diagnostic and prognostic tool for better management of early breast cancer.",Quantitative evaluation of malignant potential of early breast cancer using high resolution image cytometry.
"Analysis of silver-stained proteins associated with nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) is proposed as a marker of cellular proliferation. This study describes the application of AgNORs and Ki67 in breast lesions. Sixty-one cases including fibroadenoma (FA), fibrocystic disease (FCD), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma (IC) were studied by image analysis to evaluate quantitative changes in AgNORs in both Ki67-positive, and Ki67-negative smears. The Ki67 index was assessed. Morphometric features of cell nuclei and AgNORs were determined by digitized computer image analysis (Prodit 5.2). The growth fraction was 5.08 for FA, 5.71 for FCD, 16.75 for DCIS and 23.26 for IC. The mean nuclear area was significantly higher in malignant cells than those of fibroadenoma and fibrocystic disease. In Ki67-positive cells the total area, long axis and number of AgNORs increased progressively across disease groups. Eccentricity of AgNORs and AgNORs: nuclear area ratios were significantly increased in malignant breast lesion in comparison with benign lesion in Ki67 positive cells. In Ki67 negative cells, the highest value of AgNORs was observed in DCIS. The AgNORs: nuclear area ratio demonstrated a statistically significant trend across the disease groups. This study demonstrates that the growth fraction, mean nuclear area and selected AgNORs features have potential for differentiating benign from malignant breast tumours.",Quantitative cytological assessment of Ki67 and AgNORs using computer-digitized image analysis of four clinicopathological breast lesions.
"Using computerized image analysis, we newly devised a method for automatic quantitative evaluation of nuclear arrangements in variable proliferative intraductal (cribriform) lesions of the breast, by calculating angles of longest nuclear diameter to a horizon (LNDA). Internuclear correlation in the cribriform lesions was thus examined, comparing 22 benign and 62 malignant cases. In the malignant lesions, nuclear arrangements tended to be multidirectional, probably because of vertical nuclear arrangements toward acinar lumens as reflected by the wide distribution of LNDAs. Conversely, in the benign lesions, groups of nuclei tended to arrange toward one certain direction, forming a complex streaming pattern with the distribution of LNDAs usually producing a distinctive peak. Other conventional nuclear features, such as nuclear area, nuclear perimeter, shortest nuclear diameter (SND), and leading variables were also quantitatively assessed for multivariate analysis. It was noted that nuclear arrangements could represent a favorable discriminator. Linear discriminant function could classify 66 of the total 84 cases (78.6%) as being consistent with the diagnosis of pathologists. We conclude that internuclear arrangement could be a useful discriminating variable in benign and malignant breast lesions for the further development of an automatic analytic system.",Comparative morphometric studies of benign and malignant intraductal proliferative lesions of the breast by computerized image analysis.
"The argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NORs) was measured in the tissue sample aspirated with fine needle for 17 cases of breast benign lesion and 46 cases of breast cancer, by analysis of their micro-image with light microscope and computed. The results indicated that the amount of Ag-NORs in the nuclei of breast cancer was increased while the percentage of average areas occupied by Ag-NORs was decreased. It was significant statistically in comparing with benign lesion (P < 0.05). In addition, the amount of Ag-NORs in the nuclei of breast cancer with and that without metastasis was not different markedly (P > 0.05). However the percentage of average areas occupied by Ag-NORs was different statistically (P < 0.05). The conclusion of Ag-NORs is of benefit to distinguish from benign and malignant tumours of breast as well as significant for evaluating the prognosis for breast cancer.",[Significance of diagnosis and prognosis for breast carcinoma with examination of Ag-NORs].
"Malignancy-associated changes (MACs) have been described as subtle morphologic changes in normal-appearing tissues adjacent to or distant from malignant tumors. MACs might be applicable as a marker of occult malignancy, increased risk of subsequent carcinoma or recurrence of tumor after therapy. The aim of this study was to verify the existence of MACs in normal-appearing breast tissue adjacent to breast carcinoma. Image cytometry measurements were performed on 4-microns sections cut from formaldehyde-fixed tissue blocks and stained with thionin-SO2 following the Feulgen procedure. Morphologically normal appearing breast lobules were analyzed in patients with benign (20 cases) and malignant breast disease (23 invasive and 11 in situ tumors). The chromatin distribution features of the epithelial nuclei in normal-appearing breast lobules differed between patients with benign and malignant breast disease. Changes in nuclear features, detected in epithelial nuclei from normal-appearing lobules in breasts resected for carcinoma, were defined as MACs. The frequency of MAC nuclei was low in benign tissues, increased in tissues with ductal carcinoma in situ and highest in tissues with invasive carcinoma. Based on the measurements of nuclei in normal-appearing lobules, it was possible to discriminate between patients with benign breast disease and patients with invasive carcinoma in 86% of cases.",Malignancy-associated changes in the breast. Changes in chromatin distribution in epithelial cells in normal-appearing tissue adjacent to carcinoma.
"A computer-based automated histopathology recognition system was developed to distinguish benign from malignant lesions. Tubular carcinoma of the breast, which has several reactive and neoplastic mimics, was selected as a model. Archival stained tumour sections from the United Kingdom National External Quality Assurance Scheme for breast pathology and supplementary material from external pathologists formed the study population. A diagnostic process similar to that employed by the histopathologist was adopted, viz, low-power feature extraction and analysis by cluster/glandular groupings followed by high-power confirmation. To circumvent problems of stain variability, greyscale quantisation of images was achieved through Karhunen-Loeve transformation with results suggesting that histological stains provide information primarily through contrast and not colour. Mean nearest neighbour and variance of cell nuclei distances were found to be 100% effective in distinguishing images which contained diffuse tumour, and no clustering. Gaussian smoothing followed by minimum variance quantisation allowed segmentation of gland clusters. Perona-Malik nonlinear diffusion filter employed prior to intensity thresholding and morphological filtering was 92% (7330/7973) effective in segmenting individual glands. In a set of 62 benign and 52 malignant gland clusters, the features found to discriminate tubular carcinoma from benign conditions included > 20% of glands with sharp-angled edge, cluster area > 150,000 pixels, ratio total gland area:total cluster area < 0.14, > 60 glands per cluster and the ratio average malignant gland area:benign gland area < 0.5. Suspicious clusters were subjected to high-power feature analysis for nuclear morphology, nucleoli detection and basement membrane assessment. Watershed thresholding achieved nuclear segmentation and nuclear area > 1.3x mean benign nuclear area was found to have a malignant likelihood ratio of 14.5. Progressive thresholding was used to detect nucleoli. Basement membrane was accentuated by colour segmentation and demonstrated 0.96 sensitivity, 0.89 specificity and 0.92 positive predictive value for distinguishing malignancy.",An automated diagnostic system for tubular carcinoma of the breast--an overview of approach and considerations.
To achieve a classifier of breast lesions to discriminate between benign and malignant cases of cytologic smears with automated segmentation image analysis techniques.,Automated segmentation of cell nuclei in fine needle aspirates of the breast.
"Image analysis techniques were used to characterize individual nuclei of cells and entire clusters of cells in hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained smears of fine needle aspirates of the breast to determine the ability of these techniques to distinguish benign from malignant cases. Analysis of the individual nuclear features showed significant differences in nuclear area, shape (bending energy), texture and integrated darkness between benign and malignant samples. Analysis of the clusters demonstrated that the benign clusters were fewer in number, more cellular (average gray level) and larger than malignant clusters. A statistical classifier was constructed to test the discriminatory accuracy for benign and malignant cases. Good discrimination was found for both the individual nuclei and the clusters when analyzed separately, although a few cases were misclassified by each type of analysis. When combined, the two classifiers achieved a completely accurate classification. This suggests the complementary nature of high-resolution single-cell analysis and the more global cluster analysis techniques.",Contextual analysis complements single-cell analysis in the diagnosis of breast cancer in fine needle aspirates.
"The value of nuclear morphometry in the preoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytologic diagnosis of mammary lesions was investigated and correlated with the lymph node status of the patients. The subjects consisted of four groups of patients: 49 with invasive ductal carcinomas (18 with no positive nodes, 16 with one to three positive nodes and 15 with four or more positive nodes) and 14 patients with benign lesions. The FNA specimens were smeared onto slides and stained by the May-Grünwald-Giemsa technique. The area, perimeter and maximum diameter of 100 randomly chosen nuclei were both measured with the IBAS image analysis system and semiquantitatively estimated with an eyepiece micrometer. For all three parameters, significant differences were found between benign and malignant lesions. The mean nuclear perimeter allowed the morphometric discrimination between all four groups with statistical significance; nuclear area and maximum diameter did not discriminate patients with invasive carcinoma and one to three positive nodes from those with no positive nodes or more than three positive nodes. Morphometry proved to be far superior to eyepiece measurements with respect to accuracy and reproducibility of the results. The results suggest that nuclear perimeter can be used as an additional parameter not only for the FNA cytologic diagnosis of breast cancer, but also for the estimation of patients' prognosis.",Computerized morphometric image analysis of cytologic nuclear parameters in breast cancer.

"The measurement of nuclear area was carried out in 30 benign and 32 malignant breast lumps using Omnicon Alpha 500 Image Analyzer. The mean nuclear area of duct cells in malignant group was greater (157.6 +/- 58.64 sq.microns with a peak around 140 sq.microns) and more heterogenous within and amongst cases than observed in duct cells from most of the cases of fibroadenoma (85.05 ae 14.2 sq.microns with a peak around 80 sq.microns). Taking into consideration 110 sq.microns as a differentiating limit, a significant difference was observed between benign and malignant conditions (p). Similarly taking 118 sq.microns as differentiating limit duct cell carcinomas could be divided into two groups i.e. 9(28.1%) cases of small nuclear type with a range of 80-118 sq.microns and 23(71.9%) cases of large nuclear type with a range of 118-320 sq microns .6(18.8%) cases with small nuclei had an overlap with fibroadenoma.

"Computerized morphological analysis of the cell nuclei was performed on 66 cases (2222 nuclei) of aspirated materials from breast tumors: 25 benign cases (302 nuclei), 41 malignant cases (1420 nuclei). Its diagnostic significance and the correlation between nuclear analysis and clinical staging were studied. Nuclear diagram and intranuclear chromatin distribution pattern were evaluated using computer system named 6400. The malignant tumor had larger, more round-shaped nuclei and less uniform chromatin distribution. Under tnm classification, stage IV tumors had larger, more flattened nuclei and more irregular chromatin distribution pattern than the others. Computerized morphological analysis of breast tumors may give a quantitative aspect to classical diagnostic process. Furthermore, this analytical method provides information on clinical stage of breast cancer.",[Application of image cytometry to cytological diagnosis of breast tumors].
"Immunohistochemical expression of the cellular phosphoprotein p53 was investigated in archival, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded surgical breast tissue specimens from 543 patients using the polyclonal antibody CM-1. Cytometric DNA assessments were performed on histopathologically or cytopathologically identified cell nuclei using image analysis. The series included five samples of normal resting breast parenchyma, 35 benign lesions including benign tumors, 54 hyperplastic lesions with and without atypia, 109 carcinomas in situ, and 340 invasive adenocarcinomas. In 56 of the latter cases specimens from corresponding lymph node metastases also were investigated. Mutant p53 protein expression was absent in normal resting parenchyma and in benign lesions, including benign tumors and epithelial hyperplasias. However, 14 of the 54 hyperplasias (26%) were found to be of DNA aneuploid type. Thirteen of 109 (12%) carcinomas in situ and 79 of 340 (23%) invasive neoplasms expressed the mutant p53 protein. Eight of nine (89%) p53 immunoreactive carcinomas in situ and 62 of 78 (80%) invasive carcinomas with p53 expression were DNA aneuploid. In invasive carcinomas p53 expression was absent in well differentiate neoplasms. In contrast, 58 of 158 (37%) poorly differentiated invasive carcinomas immuoreacted. Intraductal carcinomas of comedo type and poorly differentiated invasive carcinomas of comedo type expressed the mutant p53 protein in seven of 18 cases (39%) and in 14 of 22 cases (64%), respectively. The staining behavior of lymph node metastases was the same as that of the corresponding primary tumors. The present findings suggest that chromosomal alterations as indicated by DNA aneuploidy occur in precancerous lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Immunohistochemical expression of the mutant p53 protein and nuclear DNA content during the transition from benign to malignant breast disease.
"This study explores the use of fractal analysis in the numerical description of chromatin appearance in breast cytology. Images of nuclei from fine-needle aspiration biopsies of the breast are characterized in terms of their Minkowski and spectral fractal dimensions, for 19 patients with benign epithelial cell lesions and 22 with invasive ductal carcinomas. Chromatin appearance in breast epithelial cell nuclear images is demonstrated to be fractal, suggesting that the three-dimensional chromatin structure in these cells also has fractal properties. A statistically significant difference between the mean spectral dimensions of the benign and malignant cases is demonstrated. The two fractal dimensions are very weakly correlated. A statistically significant difference between the benign and malignant cases in lacunarity, a fractal property characterizing the size of holes or gaps in a texture, is found over a wide range of scales. These differences are particularly pronounced at the smallest and largest scales, corresponding respectively to fine-scale texture, indicating whether chromatin is clumped or fine, and to large-scale structures like nucleoli. Logistic regression and artificial neural network classification models are developed to classify unknown cases on the basis of fractal measures of chromatin texture. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, the best logistic regression classifier correctly diagnoses 95.1 per cent of the cases. The best neural network model can correctly classify all of the cases, but it is unclear whether this is due to overtraining. Fractal dimensions and lacunarity are useful tools for the quantitative characterization of chromatin appearance, and can potentially be incorporated into image analysis devices to assure the quality and reproducibility of diagnosis by breast fine-needle aspiration biopsy.",Fractal characterization of chromatin appearance for diagnosis in breast cytology.
"Coarse granularity of nuclear chromatin texture is a prominent feature of most malignant cell lines. We have chosen the abrupt transition from eu- to heterochromatic foci (high contrast gradient [CG]) as a novel parameter for coarseness. This feature was quantified using automated image analysis of single nuclei in smears stained by the May-Grünwald-Giemsa technique. The principle of this approach consists of eliminating, with the help of subtraction between two image lowpass filters, the small grey level differences among pixels, so that only high CG values are retained on the digitized image. The sum of these distinctive microareas is then taken as a fraction of the area of the peripherally eroded nucleus, and this ratio is designated as contrast gradient index (CGI) per nucleus. This method was tested on fine needle aspirates from 11 patients with benign breast disease (BBD) and 14 with mammary carcinoma (CA). For each specimen, 60 nuclei were analyzed, with a measuring time per nucleus of about 1 min. A high significant distinction between epithelial cell populations in BBD and CA, respectively, was obtained by variance analysis of all CGIs per nucleus (p = 2 x 10(-18). The median and the mean values of CGI per specimen were the next best discriminators, followed by the modes and the standard deviation of CGI per specimen. The percentage of nuclei per specimen with CGI values of greater than 12 was also significantly greater in CA than in BBD.","Novel, contrast gradient-oriented, automated chromatin texture analysis.

"The expression of the c-erbB-2 proto-oncogene product was investigated immunohistochemically in 474 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human breast tissue samples. The series included 32 benign and 26 hyperplastic lesions, 32 carcinomas in situ and 384 invasive breast carcinomas, 107 of which were less than 1 cm in diameter. Cytometric DNA assessments were performed on histopathologically or cytodiagnostically identified cell nuclei, using image analysis. C-erbB-2 immunoreactivity was not seen in normal parenchyma or in benign and hyperplastic lesions. Mammary carcinomas in situ were more frequently immunoreactive (59%) than invasive neoplasms (23%). Invasive tumours more than 1 cm in diameter immunoreacted more often (26%) than small invasive carcinomas (16%). C-erbB-2 expression in regional lymph node metastases was the same as in the corresponding primary tumours. Significant differences were observed between the c-erbB-2 expression in DNA diploid and aneuploid lesions; for carcinomas in situ the figures were 40% and 72%, respectively. Invasive carcinomas of DNA diploid type rarely showed c-erb-B-2 expression, irrespective of tumour size and nodal status (7-11%). DNA aneuploid tumours were more frequently immunoreactive with increasing levels during progression (32-41%). Our data indicate that genetically stable invasive mammary tumours seem rarely to express the c-erbB-2 protein, even during progression, whereas genetically unstable invasive neoplasms frequently show c-erbB-2 immunoreactivity which increases during tumour progression.",Expression of the c-erbB-2 proto-oncogene product and nuclear DNA content in benign and malignant human breast parenchyma.
"This report describes the clinico-pathological features of myofibroblastic tumors of the breast in six patients. Four women and one man presented with a benign myofibroblastoma. The sixth patient was a woman with myofibrosarcoma. All myofibroblastomas were composed of a fascicular arrangement of spindle cells embedded in dense bundles of collagen. Tumors differed with respect to their proportion of neoplastic cells and collagenous stroma as well as cellular pleomorphism. Based on this variation, the tumors could be subclassified as classic, collagenized, epithelioid and cellular myofibroblastoma. Immunohistological staining confirmed myofibroblastic differentiation by strong expression of either desmin or smooth muscle actin with coexpression of vimentin. In addition, numerous cells reacted with antibodies to CD68. Proliferative activity was rather low in the myofibroblastoma with an average of 0-2 mitotic figures per 10 HPF. DNA cytometric analysis was performed in two cases and showed diploid stem lines with minor S-phase fractions (1% and 3%). In the myofibrosarcoma, cells contained pleomorphic nuclei with some giant cells and numerous mitotic figures (6-7/10 HPF) and had infiltrating margins that were apparent even grossly. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells strongly expressed vimentin, smooth muscle actin and fibronectin. Ultrastructurally, neoplastic cells met the criteria of myofibroblasts, i.e. contained abundant intermediate filaments and myofilament bundles with focal densities as well as fibronexus junctions. DNA cytometric analysis exhibited again a diploid stemline but marked proliferative activity was present as indicated by an S-phase fraction of 20%. In conclusion, in benign myofibroblastoma there may be some cellular pleomorphism but mitotic activity is always low. The malignant counterpart, myofibrosarcoma, is characterized by marked cellular pleomorphism, infiltrating margins and high mitotic rate.",Breast tumors with myofibroblastic differentiation: clinico-pathological observations in myofibroblastoma and myofibrosarcoma.
"An interactive computer system has been developed for evaluating cytologic features derived directly from a digital scan of breast fine needle aspirate slides. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze cell nuclei and classifies them using an inductive method based on linear programming. A digital scan of selected areas of the aspirate slide is done by a trained observer, while the analysis of the digitized image is done by an untrained observer. When trained and tested on 119 breast fine needle aspirates (68 benign and 51 malignant) using leave-one-out testing, 90% correctness was achieved. These results indicate that the method is accurate (good intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility) and that an untrained operator can obtain diagnostic results comparable to those achieved visually by experienced observers.",Breast cytology diagnosis with digital image analysis.
"Apocrine features occurring in sclerosing adenosis (apocrine adenosis), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and non-comedo ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) often add to diagnostic difficulty. We have evaluated the usefulness of DNA content determined by image analysis in apocrine metaplasia and hyperplasia, apocrine adenosis, ADH, DCIS, lobular carcinoma in situ, invasive ductal carcinoma, and infiltrating lobular carcinoma as a potential diagnostic aid in some of these problematic breast lesions with apocrine features. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma and DCIS were further subdivided into high- or low-grade category based on nuclear features. Microscopic fields containing 63 lesions were identified in slides from breast excisions. From each selected area 100 cells in corresponding fields in paired Feulgen-stained sections were digitized for computerized ploidy analysis with lymphocyte nuclei in the same slides serving as internal diploid controls. Aneuploidy was assessed using combined DNA index and modified Auer histogram criteria for DNA content abnormalities. There was strong association between the assessment of nuclear grade and ploidy (Fisher's exact test, P < .00001). All but one of the benign and low-grade malignant lesions (97%) were in the diploid range (six of seven apocrine metaplasia cases, three of three apocrine adenosis cases, 14 of 14 ADH cases, 10 of 10 low-grade DCIS cases, two of two lobular carcinoma in situ cases, and two of two infiltrating lobular carcinoma cases). In contrast, 24 of 25 (96%) of the high-grade malignant lesions were aneuploid (10 of 10 DCIS cases and 14 of 15 infiltrating ductal carcinoma cases). We conclude that DNA ploidy status does not offer additional diagnostic information to light microscopy in distinguishing among benign apocrine proliferations, ADH, and low-grade DCIS since these proliferations share a diploid range DNA content.",The histologic spectrum of apocrine breast proliferations: a comparative study of morphology and DNA content by image analysis.
"The practical applications of computer-assisted image analysis systems are multiple in oncology. The computerized system of image analysis referred to as SAMBA (TITN) is particularly relevant to analyse coloured images resulting from immunostaining or histochemical procedures assessed either on tissue sections of any type or cytological preparations (imprints, smears). The SAMBA analysis of positive Ki67 surfaces in tissue sections from breast, endometrial, ovarian, cervical or urinary bladder samples enables a multiparametric evaluation of the growth fraction (GF) in intraepithelial, borderline or invasive proliferations. Moreover, the SAMBA analysis after Feulgen staining procedures provides a parametric evaluation of the nuclei densitometry and morphological features and of the chromatin texture, which serve to compute the ploidy balance (BP) and the proliferation index (PI). In benign tumors, GF and PI are low and tumor cells are diploid with an overall high positive PB values. In malignant tumors, GF, PI and the percentage of aneuploid cells increase with tumor grade and stage whereas PB decreases. In borderline proliferations, FC, PI and PB intermediate values are recorded. These new criteria of prognosis should be assessed routinely in pathology departments and the results from these new investigations are likely to be soon implicated in the selection of patient therapy.","[Growth fraction (Ki67), ploidy balance and proliferation index in tumors of the urogenital tract and breast]."
"The ploidy profiles of benign and malignant tumours can be obtained using image analysis. However, the results of ploidy studies have varied according to the type of specimen used. We compared the ploidy profiles of paraffin embedded thin sections, cytospin preparations of disaggregated cells, and cytological smears from the same specimen as defined by image analysis. Ten benign breast lesions, 10 breast carcinomas and 10 malignant melanomas were investigated in this way. Preparations stained by the Feulgen technique were examined using the MD20 video image analysis densitometry system. Ploidy profiles were obtained by measuring the integrated optical density of at least 200 nuclei. By paying proper attention to the quality of fixation and presence or absence of cytoplasm around cells, comparable results were found for all preparations in each case. We therefore conclude that if careful attention is paid to the technical quality of the material, reliable ploidy results can be obtained by image analysis.",Comparative ploidy studies using cytological and paraffin section preparations.
"50 fine-needle biopsies of mammary tumors (20 medullary carcinomas, 20 fibroadenomas, and 10 false negative judged cases) were studied by automated microscopic image analysis. Eight morphometric and densitometric features of the tumor cell nuclei were determined on Papanicolaou stained smears. It was analyzed whether smears false judged as negative can be rightly allocated as carcinomas by the automated method. The results of this study have shown that it was possible by means of three cell nucleus parameters (standard deviation of the area, mean area ratio, and skewness of the grey value gradient at contours) with 100% correct separation of the unequivocal cytologies into malignant and benign smears to recognize about 90% of the false judged smears rightly as carcinomas. The results are reproducible and can be obtained in a time of 2-5 min per smear. The first results show that the automated microscope image analysis may be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of borderline-cases of mammary tumors.",Automated microscope image analysis in the cytological tumor diagnostics.
