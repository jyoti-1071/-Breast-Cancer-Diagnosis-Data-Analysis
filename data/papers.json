For each patient, several DNA (ploidy, S-phase fraction, exceeding rates, 2c deviation index, ploidy balance, entropy, and histogram typing), morphometric (area and radius of nuclei), and textural parameters (mainly co-occurrence and run-length) were calculated. The prognostic value of these parameters was investigated by multivariate Cox regression analysis, considering a distant recurrence-free survival of 8 years as the prognostic criterion. In the multivariate analysis, one DNA parameter (histogram type) and two textural parameters (co-occurrence and variation of the average heterochromatin area) were proven to have independent prognostic value. Using a linear combination of these variables, a prognostic factor was calculated for each individual patient. Patients were stratified using this factor into several groups according to their risk for distant recurrence. Thus, a low-risk group of stage I patients was identified, remaining distant recurrence-free for 8 years. In addition, a group of patients with a worse prognosis and an 8-year recurrence rate of about 26 per cent was identified, compared with the average distant recurrence rate of all stage I patients of 13 per cent. A combination of DNA and textural parameters can provide powerful prognostic information in stage I breast carcinomas and may allow a better selection of patients for different therapy protocols."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GSF-Neuherberg, Forschungszentrum f\u00fcr Umwelt und Gesundheit GmbH, Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie, Oberschleissheim, Germany."}], "LastName": "Aubele", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Auer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Falkmer", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Voss", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rodenacker", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "J\u00fctting", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "H\u00f6fler", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "0204634", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3417"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Neoplasm"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "therapy", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease-Free Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Image Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ploidies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prognosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8568592", "10.1002/path.1711770408"]}}, {"MedlineCitation": {"CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": [], "OtherAbstract": [], "KeywordList": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "GeneralNote": [], "PMID": "11303595", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "2001", "Month": "09", "Day": "06"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, "Article": {"ELocationID": [], "Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1055-9965", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "10", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "2001", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Cancer Epidemiol.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to prospectively identify, using objective criteria, patients who are at high risk of recurrence and might benefit from additional treatment. We conducted a multi-institutional, collaborative case-control study to identify nuclear morphometric features that would be useful for identifying women with DCIS at the highest risk of recurrence. Tissue sections of archival breast tissue of 29 women with recurrent and 73 matched women with nonrecurrent DCIS were stained for DNA, and nuclei in the DCIS lesions were evaluated by image analysis. A clear correlation between mean fractal2_area (FA2) and nuclear grade was observed (P < 0.001), allowing an objective determination of nuclear grade. Several nuclear morphometric features, including mean and variance of variation of radius, mean area, mean and variance of frequency of high boundary harmonics (FQH), and variance in sphericity, were found to be useful in discriminating recurrent from nonrecurrent DCIS subjects. However, the nuclear features associated with recurrence differed between high- and low-grade lesions. For lesions with high FA2 (nuclear grade 3), mean variation of radius, mean FQH, and mean area alone yielded recurrence odds ratios of 4.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-45.96], 3.86 (95% CI, 0.88-16.98), 2.90 (95% CI, 0.31-27.2), respectively. Using a summed feature model, high-FA2 lesions showing three poor prognostic features had an odds ratio of 15.63 (95% CI, 1.22-200), compared with those with zero or one poor prognostic feature. Lesions with low mean FA2 (nuclear grade 1 or 2) showing high variances in sphericity and FQH had an odds ratio of 7.71 (95% CI, 1.77-33.60). Addition of other features did not enhance the odds ratio or its significance. These results suggest that nuclear image analysis of DCIS lesions may provide an adjunctive tool to conventional pathological analysis, both for the objective assessment of nuclear grade and for the identification of features that predict patient outcome."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, University of Texas M.
